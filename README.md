# VGG16-CXR-COVID19-Classification

Welcome to the VGG16-CXR-COVID19-Classification repository. This repository focuses on the classification of COVID-19 cases in chest X-ray images using the VGG16 architecture through transfer learning. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, providing a diverse collection of chest X-ray images for training and evaluation.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to leverage the power of transfer learning using the VGG16 model to accurately classify chest X-ray images as COVID-19 positive or negative.

## Contents

- **Notebook**: The Jupyter notebook in this repository guides you through the complete process of transfer learning using VGG16. It covers data preprocessing, model configuration, training, and saving the model weights in JSON format.
